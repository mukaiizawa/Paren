# NAME
function - function data type.

# DESCRIPTION
A function data type is a sub-program that can be called by code external (or internal in the case of recursion) to the function.

Like the program itself, a function is composed of a sequence of expression called the function body.

Arguments can be passed to a function, and the function will return a value.

In Paren, functions are first-class objects, so it can also be given to the argument of the function.
