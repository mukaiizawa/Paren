# NAME
keyword - keyword type.

# DESCRIPTION
Keywords always behave like symbols that bind themselves.

Like symbols, there is only one keyword with the same name in the system, so identity verification can be done by address comparison.

Therefore, it can be used like a dictionary key or enumeration.

Keywords can be generated by keyword literals or keyword(3) functions.

# EXAMPLES

    ) :foo
    :foo
    ) (== (keyword "foo") :foo)
    true

# SEE ALSO
- keyword(3)
- symbol(7)
