# NAME
array - array type.

# DESCRIPTION
An array contains objects arranged according to a Cartesian coordinate system.

Create by specifying the size with the `array(3)` function.

Elements can be referenced and updated by calling the `[](3)` function.

Any data type can be treated as a value.

# NOTES
Since the array is guaranteed to have contiguous memory, any element can be accessed with `O(1)`.
