# NAME
association-list - a list of conses representing an association.

# DESCRIPTION
An association list is a list of cons that represent key-value associations.

The even-numbered elements corresponds to the key and the odd-numbered elements corresponds to the value.

Since the search time is `O(n)`, use dictionary when dealing with large elements.

# NOTES
The definition is different from the association list of Common Lisp.

- assoc(3)
- cons(7)
