# NAME
list - chain of conses.

# DESCRIPTION
A list is a cons data type or symbol `nil`.

Lists are one of Paren's major data structures, and Paren source code is made of lists.

Thus, Paren programs can manipulate source code as a data structure, giving rise to the macro systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or new domain-specific languages embedded in Paren.
