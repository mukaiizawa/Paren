# NAME
cons - cons data type.

# DESCRIPTION
A cons data type is a compound data object having two components called the `car` and the `cdr`.

Cons can be generated by the function `cons`, or it can be generated internally by using list literals.

# NOTES
Unlike general Lisp-like languages, Paren cannot generate cons such that cdr is not a list.

The constraint that lists are nil-terminated forces inefficient data structures when expressing pairs and the like.

On the other hand, the list manipulation function has the advantage of being very concise and clear because it is assumed to be nil-terminated.

# EXAMPLES

    ) (cons 1 nil)
    (1)
    ) (cons 1 (cons 2 nil))
    (1 2)
    ) (list 1 2)
    (1 2)
    ) (car (list 1 2))
    1
    ) (cdr (list 1 2))
    (2)
    ) (cadr (list 1 2))
    2
